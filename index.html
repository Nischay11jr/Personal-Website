            <h2>Who am I?</h2>
            <p>
                Nischay is a 19 year old from India and now lives in Cork. Currently, I am a student at <b>University
                    College Cork(UCC)</b> studying BSc(Hons) in Computer Sciences. I was born in New Delhi and
                completed my high school years from <a href="https://vvdav.org">VVDAV Public school</a>.

            <h2>What do I like?</h2>
            <p>I have a keen interest in Football. I even played for U-18 <a href="www.delhiyouthleague.com">Delhi
                    Youth League</a> from <a href="https://www.conscientfootball.com/">Conscient football</a>. I
                consider the Brazilian <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neymar">Neymar Jr</a> as my idol. I also
                like to cook sometimes. One of my interesting hobbies is photographing as well. I love going to clubs
                and socialize with people and get to know about them. I am fond of traveling
                as well and loves exploring different cultures and
                traditions about different parts of the world.

            <h2>What do I think of myself?</h2>
            <p>I am more practical towards life. I want to do more in my life, never
                satisfied with myself. I believe that <strong>"There is no such thing as motivation. It comes and goes.
                    The only thing that makes you achieve something is your discipline."</strong>

        <section id="column">
            <h2>What have I achieved yet?</h2>
            <p>Not a lot of things but enough to keep me motivating to do more. I was my school's one of the MVP players
                in
                Football. Also, I got to lead my school team for my last year in high school and we won the zonals that
                year. I have also been a part of DAV Nationals Football Team. I was also an Enterpreneur in India. I was
                working with one of my friends in the sneaker world. </p>

            <h2>What is that one memorable incident that I never forget?</h2>
            <p>I was in my 10th standard and there were only few weeks left for my final exams. Meanwhile, I was playing
                a football tournament from <a href="https://www.conscientfootball.com/">Conscient football</a>. I had to
                appear for the tournament by any means as some recruiters were present at the tournament to recruit for
                <a href="https://i-league.org/">I-League</a>. I still remember the date, it was 10th of September in
                2018. My social studies final exam was approaching in the next few days. I did everything I could to
                convince my Mom to let me go. It was a hard time back then, as there were matches on alternate days,
                over that the
                matches were finishing at 9 pm and then I am reaching back home tired, then, I am studying 2 hours
                straight. At the end of the month, my coach told me that I made it in the I-league summer camp and
                later the exam results came out to be pretty good as well. I still can't believe how I managed to handle
                both of them for which it makes a memorable memory.

            <h2>What is the one thing I am deeply proud of in my life?</h2>
            <p> The one thing I am proud of myself is engaging myself in different activities, be it sports, being a
                part of small business or cleaning dishes. I feel really proud of what I have achieved till now as a
                teenager. I feel that I have
                not wasted my teenage life in doing what most of the teens do instead gain experience as much as I
                could. Every activity has taught me some lesson. I believe the people
                you are surrounded with influence the most. These things has helped me a lot skill wise as well as
                mentally.
