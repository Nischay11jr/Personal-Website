        <h1>Nischay's Travel Dictionary</h1>

        <h2>"The world is a book and those who do not travel, read only one page."</h2>
        <p>The dictionary is quite short till now but I will keep exploring the wonders of our fabulous planet and keep
            updating this dictionary. The places mentioned below are the ones that I have experienced so far and what I
            have experienced there. Also, there are few recommendations after each country
            that I believe one must visit but that's not it, you can obviously visit more places and explore
            more.

            <h2>SWITZERLAND</h2>
            <p>Switzerland was absolutely a memorable experience. It's no secret that Switzerland has scenery in spades.
                Switzerland is a country that's blessed with natural wonders and curious national customs in almost
                equal measure. The small European country is big on towering, snow-capped mountains, shimmering lakes,
                storybook villages, and vibrant cities. For active vacationers, Switzerland offers virtually every
                winter sport,
                including, of course, some of the world's best skiing, plus hiking, biking, climbing, hang-gliding, and
                other
                temptations for adrenaline junkies. There's also plenty to fill a more leisurely vacation, with hearty
                cuisine,
                including what some say is the world's finest chocolate, high-end shopping, first-rate museums Whether
                you want
                to stare down at the sprawling expanse of Europe's longest glacier or watch grown men bear hug each
                other into
                submission in a sand pit, there's plenty of truly unique experiences to be had in the Alpine country.

            <p>
                &#x2192 Did you know that the Alps are the most densely populated mountain range in the world with a
                total of 11 million people? In addition, there are of course millions of tourists and day trippers every
                year who enjoy the nature of the Alps and go on great hikes and excursions.
            </p>
            <p>
                &#x2192 This landlocked alpine country with its glaciers has a Mediterranean south called Ticino.
                Bordering
                Italy, Ticino has a mild climate and is home to a lush vegetation. It also boasts Europe's second
                highest longevity with an average lifespan of 85.2 years.
            </p>

            <p>
                &#x2192 Kim Jong Un, the North Korean dictator, lived in a Bern suburb for about four years. He lived
                there
                under a disguise with his aunt, attended the Liebefeld-Steinhölzli international school, played
                basketball and skied in the Alps. His favorite dish allegedly was raclette, and his classmates thought
                he was Thai.

        <section id="Italy">
            <h2>ITALY</h2>
            <p>Visiting Spain was one of the best journeys I've ever had. Italy's cities offer an enticing mix of
                scenery,
                historic and ancient sites, museums and of course, great cuisine and ambiance. Its exquisite beauty, its
                relaxed
                pace, its startling integration of the ancient and the modern, it all contributes to the magic which
                makes it
                one of the most visited countries in the world. The amount of time you have in Italy will likely dictate
                how
                many places you can visit there. Many travelers choose the classic itinerary of Rome, Florence, and
                Venice,
                perhaps with a side trip through Tuscany. Yet there are so many great places to discover in Italy.</p>

            <h3>"Alcuni Fatti Interessanti" (Some Interesting Facts)</h3>
            <p>
                &#x2192 Don't be surprised if your hotel in Italy doesn't have a 17th floor. Italians believe that this
                number is unlucky because when the Roman numeral for 17 (XVII) is rearranged it looks like VIXI, which
                means “I have lived,” a symbol that's associated with death.
            </p>

            <p>
                &#x2192 The colors of the Italian flag green, white, and red have special meaning. Green represents
                hope,
                white represents faith, and red signals charity.
            </p>

            <p>
                &#x2192 According to Italians, placing a hat on a bed is bad luck. Traditionally, when priests visited
                the
                dying to give them their last rights, they would remove their hat and put it on the bed.
